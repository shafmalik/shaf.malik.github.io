## Micro Projects
- ### Statistics and Machine Learning
    - [Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/archd3sai/Statistical-Methods/blob/master/genetic-algorithm.ipynb) : In this file, I have implemented simple genetic algorithm that finds out the list of numbers which equal to any specified number when summed together.
    - [Bayesian Statistics](https://github.com/archd3sai/Statistical-Methods/blob/master/Bayesian%20Statistics.ipynb) : In this file, I explored how bayesian statistics works and how prior assumption reflects posterior probabilities using Gun control example. 
    - [Gaussian Mixture Model and Expectation Maximization](https://github.com/archd3sai/Statistical-Methods/blob/master/GMM-EM.ipynb): In this file, I implemented Expectation Maximization algorithm to find out true distribution of one dimensional GMM of 2 gaussians.
    - [Linear Regression](https://github.com/archd3sai/Statistical-Methods/blob/master/Linear%20Regression.ipynb): In this file, I aim to solve linear regression using analytical method and also by implementing gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent and minibatch gradient descent algorithms. 
    - [Neural Network Implementation](https://github.com/archd3sai/Statistical-Methods/blob/master/NN%20Implementation.ipynb): In this file, I implemented simple neural
